## Rules

- **Never run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git command that writes to or modifies repository history or remotes.** If a task requires committing or pushing, stop and tell the user to run the git command manually.

### Pre-commit safety check

Before telling the user to commit, always run `/pre-commit-review`. It checks for secrets, sensitive identifiers, PII, credential templates, and cluster safety, and returns explicit verdicts on whether the changes are safe for a public repo. Once it confirms the changes are safe, offer the user a suggested commit message — do not run `git commit` yourself.

## Philosophy: Grug-Brained Development

> "Complexity very, very bad." — [grugbrain.dev](https://grugbrain.dev/)

- **Say no.** The best weapon against complexity is the word "no". No new feature, no new abstraction, until it earns its place.
- **No abstraction until a pattern repeats three times.** Let cut points emerge naturally from the code; don't invent them up front.
- **80/20 solutions.** Ship 80% of the value with 20% of the code. Ugly but working beats elegant but over-engineered.
- **Chesterton's Fence.** Understand why code exists before removing it. If you don't see the use, go away and think.
- **Boring, obvious code wins.** Intermediate variables with good names beat clever one-liners. Easier to debug.
- **DRY is not a law.** A little copy-paste beats a complex abstraction built for two cases.
- **No FOLD** (Fear Of Looking Dumb). If something is too complex, say so. That's a signal to simplify, not a personal failing.
